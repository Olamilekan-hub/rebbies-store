## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Submit review when logged out (should prompt login)
- [ ] Submit review when logged in (should succeed)

## 🎯 Verified Purchase Logic

A review is marked as "verified" if the user has purchased the product with status:
- `completed`
- `delivered`
- `processing`

**Database Query:**
```javascript
const hasPurchased = await prisma.customer_order_product.findFirst({
  where: {
    productId: productId,
    customerOrder: {
      email: userEmail,
      status: { in: ['completed', 'delivered', 'processing'] }
    }
  }
});
```

---

## 📊 Rating Calculation

Product ratings are automatically updated when:
1. A new review is submitted
2. A review is deleted

**Algorithm:**
```javascript
const allReviews = await prisma.review.findMany({
  where: { productId }
});

const averageRating = Math.round(
  allReviews.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.rating, 0) / allReviews.length
);

await prisma.product.update({
  where: { id: productId },
  data: { rating: averageRating }
});
```

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Duplicate Prevention:** Users can only review a product once
2. **Input Sanitization:** All inputs are validated
3. **Email Verification:** Email must match logged-in user
4. **Rate Limiting:** API requests are rate-limited
5. **XSS Protection:** HTML is sanitized before display
